Hi! I'm Michael Pang, a Canadian living in the great American city of Chicago. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2019 and now I spend my time finding patterns in data for a hedge fund. When I'm not cursing at missing values, you can find me working on GitHub projects, checking out new restaurants, or exploring the city.

### More Information

I'll write something here when I'm more interesting.
