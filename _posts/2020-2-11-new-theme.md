title: New theme
---

I'm trying out a new theme on my blog, [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com). It looked fantastic on the demo site, but then after trying it on mine I came to the conclusion that no theme can save a site with no content. In an effort to remedy this, I'm pumping out a quick blog post to see what my site would look like if it were a bit less empty. At some point I'll probably resort to a large banner design, similar to [Andrej Karpathy's website](karpathy.github.io) or [this ugly website](www.naut.ca) ;)

This theme also comes with a few bells and whistles like Disqus commenting and built-in SVG icons, however it didn't come with a Hacker News icon. I was only able to find a square one, so if anyone finds a circular HN logo please let me know in the comments!

Finally, I've set myself the goal of making each blog post longer than the average length of the previous posts, as I'm often too concise in my writing, sometimes to an unnatural degree, and I need to use more of these words called adjectives. Prioritizing quantity over quality tends is oft-cited advice for overcoming writer's block - and it's working well for me so far!
