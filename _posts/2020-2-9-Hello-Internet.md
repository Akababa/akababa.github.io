title: Hello internet!
---

I've just moved to Chicago and I'm getting settled in my new home! I grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba so I know a thing or two about cold weather and so far the city's been treating me well.

I know this website is a bit lacking in the visual department, but I've got plans to address that! I actually set up this site on the advice of a friend who told me it would be a great way to improve my writing, which I've honestly been wanting to do for my whole life. Too often I wish my writing skills were better (this included), so I decided to do something proactive about it. So please, feel free to join me as I embark on this crash course of a blog. I won't set any explicit goals for myself just yet, but I hope that one day I'll look back on this post and see how far I've come.
