# Behold, my website!
![shamelessly stolen from a lesser website (www.naut.ca)](images/gradient_header_1x.jpg)

## Who am I?
I'm Michael Pang, a Canadian living in the great American city of Chicago. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2019 and now I spend my time finding patterns in data for a hedge fund. When I'm not cursing at missing values, you can find me working on GitHub projects, checking out new restaurants, or exploring the city.

## What is this site?
It's just a blog for now, but I might also host personal projects here in the future. Stay tuned!
