# Hello internet!

I've just moved to Chicago from Waterloo, Ontario and I'm getting settled in my new home!
I grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba so I know a thing or two about cold weather and so far the city's been treating me well.
This website is a bit lacking in the visual department for now, but rest assured I've got plans to address that!
I actually set up this site on the advice of a friend who told me it would be a great way to improve my writing, which I've honestly been wanting to do for my whole life.
Too often I wish my writing skills were better (this included) and it's about time I did something proactive about it.
So please, be welcome to join me as I embark on this crash course of a blog.
I won't set any explicit goals for myself just yet, but I hope that one day I'll look back on this post and see how far I've come.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Akababa/akababa.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Akababa/akababa.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
