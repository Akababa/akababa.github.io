Hi! I'm Michael Pang, a Canadian living in the great American city of Chicago. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2019 and now I spend my time playing with data for a hedge fund. When I'm not cursing at missing values, you can find me working on GitHub projects, ordering Uber Eats, or wandering aimlessly outside.
